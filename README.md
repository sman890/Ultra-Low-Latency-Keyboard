# Ultra-Low-Latency-Keyboard

A compact, custom mechanical keyboard focused on minimizing the delay from pressing a key to the computer receiving the signal. The project covers hardware design, selection of a fast microcontroller, firmware tuning, and real-world latency measurement so the final board is proven fast, not just claimed to be. It aims to match or approach the responsiveness of today’s highest‑speed keyboards by carefully optimizing the scanning, reporting, and overall signal path, then documenting each design choice and its measured impact.
